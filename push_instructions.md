The push to your GitHub repository failed due to authentication issues. I cannot directly push to your repository as I do not have your credentials.

To push the changes, please run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You will likely be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password or a personal access token. If you have 2FA enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token.

Once you have successfully pushed the changes, your code will be on `https://github.com/jcubeart-ux/product-builder`.
